## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with the **Basics** section to ensure a strong foundation
2. Move on to **Arrays** and **Strings** for fundamental data structures
3. Learn **Objects** for more complex data organization
4. Study **Recursion** for advanced problem-solving techniques
5. Master **Searching** and **Sorting** algorithms
6. Practice with the provided examples and problems

## 💻 Usage

Each topic directory contains:

- `index.js` - Implementation and examples
- `README.md` - Detailed explanations and documentation

To use this repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA_with_JavaScript.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd DSA_with_JavaScript

# Navigate to specific topic
cd Arrays  # or any other topic directory
```

## 📝 Code Examples

Each section includes practical examples. Here's a quick sample:

```javascript
// Array example
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr.map((x) => x * 2)); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Object example
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["name", "age"]

// Recursion example
function factorial(n) {
  return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```
